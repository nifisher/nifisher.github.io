## .why  
Years ago, I figured that an on-line portfolio might be a useful
thing to have in my job search efforts.   Plus, every now and again 
I figure that I should review that I really don't know HTML/CSS very
well and maybe try to fix that.  Attempts have been made in the past
but were shut down for various reasons.  Since I'm not using my github
account actively, I figured I should look into the gitpages option
and see how it works out of me to these ends.

## .who  
I have been doing software development for almost twenty years at this
point.  Graduated with a Computer Engineering degree at the end of the
dot com boom meant that graduation day was spent learning who's job 
offers were pulled that morning.  I made it through though and managed
to get a feel for what I was doing.

Later I decided that I should go back to school and pick up a law degree.
Officially this was to expand my employment options and better myself by
picking up some knowledge that seemed intriguing.  Unofficially I just 
wanted to be able to quote *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* with
gravitas.

## .what  
Here is where I plan to put up small projects that I'm working on and 
anything I feel like sharing.  Honestly I don't expect much to show up
quickly; I mean, if I've been coding all day at work, I generally have
other stuff to do when I get home.  But with school coming to an end, 
I've got some projects that I want to dabble in.

## .when  
I've got nothing...

## .where  
Github Pages.   Have not been using my [Github account](https://github.com/nifisher)
enough, and this seemed as good an excuse as any.

## .how  
Using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for page creation.  At one point I
was raiding the [monoChrome](https://github.com/dyutibarma/monochrome) 
theme for ideas and CSS, but at this point I'm not sure how much is left
from there.
