# .{{ page.title }}
## .why  
Years ago, I figured that an on-line portfolio might be a useful
thing to have in my job search efforts.   Plus, every now and again 
I figure that I should review my knowledge of HTML/CSS and maybe improve
it some.  Attempts at websites have been made in the past
but were shut down for various reasons.  As Github offers this hosting,
I figured I should look into the gitpages option and see how well it works 
to these ends.

## .who  
I have been doing software development for over twenty years at this
point.  Graduated with a Computer Engineering degree at the end of the
dot com boom meant that graduation day was spent learning who's job 
offers were pulled that morning.  I made it through though and managed
to get a feel for what I was doing.

Later I decided that I should go back to school and pick up a law degree.
Officially this was to expand my employment options and better myself by
picking up some knowledge that seemed intriguing.  Unofficially I just 
wanted to be able to quote *Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas* with
gravitas.

## .what  
Here is where I plan to put up small projects that I'm working on and 
anything I feel like sharing.  Honestly I don't expect much to show up
quickly; I mean, if I've been coding all day at work, I generally have
other stuff to do when I get home.  But I've always got some small 
projects that I want to dabble in when time can be found.

## .when  
I've got nothing...

## .where  
Github Pages.   I had not been using my [Github account](https://github.com/nifisher)
enough, and this seemed as good an excuse as any.

## .how  
Using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) for page creation.  At one point I
was raiding the [monoChrome](https://github.com/dyutibarma/monochrome) 
theme for ideas and CSS, but at this point I'm not sure how much is left
from there.  Any other stolen or borrowed code should be linked in the html 
source.
