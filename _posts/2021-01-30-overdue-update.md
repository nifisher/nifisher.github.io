Truth be told, I don't really have an update to post, but I haven't in a while, so I wanted to toss something up.

Not much to say really though; I started a new job after Toshiba doing Continuing Product Development.  That is 
to say that developers are precious princesses who can't be bothered to do things like "maintain" or "fix" their
code after the write it, so they hired me to do that.  It's a solid job though; it pays well and keep me at that 
right level of feeling stupid because I'm not figuring stuff out quickly enough (too easy and I'll get bored, too 
hard and I'll get over stressed). 

I should hustle more legal work though.  I haven't been doing enough of that.
