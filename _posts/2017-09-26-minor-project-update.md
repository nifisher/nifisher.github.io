Finally got around to putting something on the [.projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) page.

I had a small vehicle issue driving to work last week which forced my hand and led me to buy a car sooner than I had 
planned too (though not by much).  It did relieve some of the stress from my plate though so I finally got around to
making an update I've been meaning to do.

Somewhere around 10 years ago I interviewed with a small local company that basically existed to solve problems and 
improve the performance of other company's equipment.  Like improve the sensors in airplane shock absorbers to better
estimate the life of the part.  It was kind of like a small engineering company, but no one there was a licensed engineer 
(so they couldn't sign off on things, just propose solutions for companies to implement).  I loved the company after
the interview; everyone I met was great and the work seemed interesting and entertaining.  Sadly, though they were
extending me an offer, contracts fell through and they didn't get the funding that they thought the had, so it never
came to be.

Regardless, part of the interview was a basic coding sample question.  The idea was that they were scanning the profile
of a screw and they needed to fine the peaks and valleys of the thread.  I wrote more than they expected, but I had to figure out some math I had never used before, so the excess was mostly for me.   What I sent them I posted over on the [cardinal splines]({{ site.url }}/projects/cardinal-splines) post.
