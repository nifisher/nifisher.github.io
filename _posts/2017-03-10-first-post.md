I think at this point I've got enough in place that I should start putting up content.

Still a few pages that need to be done, but they will come in time.  Mostly I just wanted to figure
out this Jekyll and Github pages stuff.  So far it seems to be straightforward and looks like I'll
be spending more time trying to figure out CSS settings.
