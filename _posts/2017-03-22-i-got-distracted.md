I really did mean to update after that last post, but it's been a busy two weeks.  I've got some more up now though.

I figured that school and some volunteer work took precedence, so I was tied up with that.  Plus, there was some
Jekyll magic I was trying to figure out.  Of course, I later learned that i was doing things the wrong way and 
switched to a "better" approach.

The [.projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) page is still missing.  I know this.  I've got some old code 
to seed it with, but I don't feel like putting in much of a place holder until I get that up.  At least I got the 
[.about]({{ site.url }}/about) and [.résumé]({{ site.url }}/resume) pages up.  I'm not entirely happy
with how .résumé displays, but it gets the information across, but part of that is from
[markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) not being the quite right format for me to be using.  I
might have to redo it in straight HTML or build a template.  It works for now though.
