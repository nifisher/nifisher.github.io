Classes are finished.  Well, finals this week, but nothing I'm too worried about.

I said last time I'd have something up soon. Clearly I failed at this.  Life got in the way with a new job and school
and what not. I've got a plan for some stuff for the [.projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) page and since my evenings
and weekends now consist of "study for the bar" I probably will need a distraction every now and again.  Hopefully I 
update sooner than once a month though.

Started with Toshiba as a contractor at the beginning of the month. Ran into a guy last week who, right before I was
brought on, was laid off after 15 years.  He was on a different team than I joined, so I didn't take over his role
but his old office would have been within throwing distance of mine.  Small world I guess.
