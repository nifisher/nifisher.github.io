Just a quick update.  As per the letter I received last week, I've passed the NC State Bar.

Unfortunately, life is still getting in the way.  Mostly car shopping and it's keeping me from 
more interesting things that I should be working on and putting up on the [.projects]({{ site.url }}/projects) page.
Plus work is getting into crunch time and I need to make sure that I'm carrying my weight.   So hopefully soon...
